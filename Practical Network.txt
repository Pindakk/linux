Practical network:


CIDR: CIDR means Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It uses a hierarchical addressing scheme based on VLSM


30-bit mask


192.168.0.0/30: could be used to address the point to point serial link between two sites.

Route flapping: interfaces rapidly alternates between up and down states

NAT: Network Address Translation!
How works: Internal host with a private address transmit a packet to a destination in the internet,
The pack is received by NAT-enabled device (router).
The it replaces the inside IP address with a globally unique IP address. When an outside sends a response,
The NAT-enabled device receives it, checks the correspondent table of network address tranlations and replaces the destination address with the original internal source.

Can ocurr dynamically or statically

IP helper addresses: 
IP helper addresses can help router to accept a broadcast request for a UDP service and then forward to a specific IP address.

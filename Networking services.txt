Change directory into mydir1, and then copy "lines" into the current directory. 

Copy lines into mydir1: Assuming you are already in mydir1 after the first command:

bash

    cp ../lines .

The first command changes the current directory to mydir1, 
and the second command copies the lines file from its parent directory (demo) into the current directory (mydir1). 
The . at the end of the cp command means "current directory."



CAT = concatinate

cat file1 file2 file3

cat file1 file2 > newfile

cat file1 file2 >> existing file


Still in mydir1, concatinate info2 and lines and file1 from test1, saving the output as "joined2". 

cat info2 lines ../test1/file1 > joined2




    Create a new directory called etccopy in /home/demo:

    bash

mkdir /home/demo/etccopy

Copy all files from /etc that begin with "u" and end with ".conf" to the etccopy directory without copying subdirectories:

bash

cp /etc/u*.conf /home/demo/etccopy/

Explanation:

mkdir /home/demo/etccopy: Creates a directory named etccopy in /home/demo.
cp /etc/u*.conf /home/demo/etccopy/: This command copies all files in /etc that match the pattern u*.conf (start with "u" and end with ".conf") into the new directory. 
The wildcard * matches any characters in between.


ls -d 
    ls -d * | grep -E '[0-9]+' > /home/demo/digit

Explanation:

    cd /etc: Changes the working directory to /etc.
    ls -d *: Lists all files and directories in the current directory (/etc) without descending into subdirectories (-d prevents recursion).
    grep -E '[0-9]+': Filters the list to include only those names that contain one or more digits.
	
	
	    > /home/demo/digit: Redirects the output to a file called digit in /home/demo.

This will save the list in digit without any /etc/ prefixes.

ls -d /etc/* | grep -E '/etc/.*[0-9]+' > /home/demo/digit2  explain what this those

Let's break down the command ls -d /etc/* | grep -E '/etc/.*[0-9]+' > /home/demo/digit2 step by step:

    ls -d /etc/*:
        ls: This command lists the contents of a directory.
        -d: This option tells ls to list only the names of the directories themselves, not their contents. This prevents recursion into subdirectories.
        /etc/*: The wildcard * matches all files and directories in the /etc directory. This means that it will list every item located directly under /etc.

    | (pipe):
        The pipe (|) takes the output from the command on its left (ls -d /etc/*) and uses it as input for the command on its right (grep -E '/etc/.*[0-9]+').

    grep -E '/etc/.*[0-9]+':
        grep: This command is used for searching text using patterns.
        -E: This option enables extended regular expressions, allowing for more complex pattern matching.
        '/etc/.*[0-9]+': This pattern is being searched for in the input:
            '/etc/': Matches the prefix /etc/, ensuring that only paths starting with this string are considered.
            '.*': Matches zero or more characters following the /etc/ prefix, effectively allowing for any file or directory name.
            [0-9]+: Matches one or more digits (0 through 9) anywhere in the name.

    > /home/demo/digit2:
        The > operator redirects the output from the grep command to a file.
        /home/demo/digit2: This specifies the path where the output will be saved. If the file digit2 already exists, it will be overwritten; if it does not exist, it will be created.

Summary:

The entire command does the following:

    Lists all files and directories directly under /etc.
    Filters this list to only include those that contain one or more digits in their names, ensuring that each entry includes the /etc/ prefix.
    Saves the filtered list to a file called digit2 in the /home/demo directory.

This command is useful for quickly identifying configuration files or directories in /etc that may have version numbers or other numerical identifiers in their names. Let me know if you have any more questions!



head -n 5000 words | tail -n 1

Explanation:

    head -n 5000 words: This command outputs the first 5000 lines of the file words.
    | (pipe): This passes the output of the head command to the next command.
    tail -n 1: This command takes the last line from the output of the previous command, which will be line 5000.

Result:

Running this command will display the word that appears on line 5000 of the file words. If you're using a case-sensitive search, just be aware that the result will reflect the exact casing used in the file.

Let me know if you have any questions!



cat you do not have to always create a new file!



FIND COMMAND-
Use the find command to locate all files which start with an "a" and end in a ".conf" which exist somewhere in /usr/share. Save this list to a file '/home/demo/alist'. Make sure that the first parameter of find is "/usr/share". 
Run the command as user "demo" and do not worry about any permission error messages.

sudo -u demo find /usr/share -type f -name 'a*.conf' > /home/demo/alist
